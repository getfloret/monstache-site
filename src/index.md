# Monstache

Sync MongoDB to Elasticsearch in realtime

---

[Monstache](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache) is a sync daemon written in Go that continously 
indexes your MongoDB collections into Elasticsearch. Monstache gives you the ability to use 
Elasticsearch to do complex searches and aggregations of your MongoDB data and easily build realtime 
Kibana visualizations and dashboards.
