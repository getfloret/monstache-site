## Contributing

The Monstache project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers and
users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of
ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- [Documentation](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache-site) improvements
- [Bug reports](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/issues) and patch reviews

### Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform, Monstache
version, MongoDB version, and Elasticsearch version.

### Testing the Development Version

If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of
Monstache you can do so with the following commands. This can be useful if you
want to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you
have encountered is fixed in the git master. You will need at least golang `1.11`
which includes native go modules support.

```bash
cd ~/build # somewhere outside your $GOPATH
git clone https://github.com/rwynn/monstache.git
cd monstache
# make changes as necessary
go install
# the resulting monstache binary will be in $GOPATH/bin
```

### Running the tests

To run the tests without Docker, you will need to have local mongod and elasticsearch servers running.  
Then you will need to start a monstache process in one terminal or in the background.

```bash
monstache -verbose
```

Finally in another terminal you can run the tests by issuing the following commands 

```bash
cd monstache
go test -v
```

!!! warning

	Running the Monstache tests will perform modifications to the `test.test` namespace in 
	MongoDB and will index documents in the `test.test` index in Elasticsearch.  If you have
	data that you need to keep on your local servers, make a back up before running the tests.

!!! note

	If you don't want to setup MongoDB and Elasticsearch on your machine another option for running the tests
	is via Docker. After cloning the monstache repo you can cd into the `docker/test` directory and run 
	`run-tests.sh`.  You will need recent versions of `docker` and `docker-compose` to run the tests this way.
	Services for MongoDB and Elasticsearch will be started and the tests run on any changes you have made to the 
	source code.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.

## Release Notes

### [monstache v4.16.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.16.1)

* Fix bug in mongoX509Settings validate (issue #198)
* Fix issue stopping monstache when using legacy oplog tailing (non change-stream) of a sharded cluster
* Upgrade golang on release builds to 1.12.1
* Upgrade docker images to use Alpine 3.9.2

### [monstache v3.23.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.23.1)

* Fix bug in mongoX509Settings validate (issue #198)
* Fix issue stopping monstache when using legacy oplog tailing (non change-stream) of a sharded cluster
* Upgrade golang on release builds to 1.12.1
* Upgrade docker images to use Alpine 3.9.2

### [monstache v4.16.0 (4tsb)](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.16.0)

* Add a new integer setting `direct-read-concur` which, when set, limits the number of concurrent direct reads that will be performed.  E.g. if you have `direct-read-namespaces` set to 23 namespaces and `direct-read-concur` set to 2, then monstache will read and sync namespace 1 and 2 concurrently and wait for both to finish before starting 3 and 4 - and so on.  
* Add the ability to disable direct read collection splitting by setting `direct-read-split-max` to -1.  By default, monstache will split each direct read collection up to 9 times and read each segment in a separate go routine.  If you don't want to split collections at all then set `direct-read-split-max` to -1. 

### [monstache v3.23.0 (4tsb)](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.23.0)

### [monstache v4.15.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.15.1)

* Upgrade golang to 1.12
* Fix a panic under some conditions when processing the result of a golang plugin `Map` function

### [monstache v3.22.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.22.1)

* Upgrade golang to 1.12
* Fix a panic under some conditions when processing the result of a golang plugin `Map` function

### [monstache v4.15.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.15.0)

* This release adds the ability for MongoDB 4+ users to open change streams against entire
  databases or entire deployments.  See the documentation for the `change-stream-namespaces`
  option for details.

* The `resume`, `resume-from-timestamp`, `replay`, and `cluster-name` options can now be used
  in conjunction with `change-stream-namespaces` if you have MongoDB 4 or greater.

* Improved support for connecting directly to shards when authorization is required on the connection.
  This is only applicable if you are not using change streams and you are connecting to a sharded 
  MongoDB deployment. In that case Monstache needs to discover and connect directly to shards. In this
  case it will reuse the login info from the initial connection to the `mongos` server when connecting to
  the shards.

### [monstache v4.10.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.10.2)

* Fixes related to i/o timeout errors
* Default timeout configurations changed to no timeout (0) with the exception of the initial connection to MongoDB which times out after 15 seconds.  Values of 0 disable timeouts.  All other positive values are in seconds.  New defaults shown below.  You probably do not need to specify any of these values unless you encounter problems.   

```
[mongo-dial-settings]
timeout=15
read-timeout=0
write-timeout=0

[mongo-session-settings]
socket-timeout=0
sync-timeout=0
```

### [monstache v3.17.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.17.2)

* Fixes related to i/o timeout errors

### [monstache v4.10.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.10.0)

* Fix for issue #97 where monstache would exit before syncing all documents with `-exit-after-direct-reads` enabled
* Support added for MongoDB change streams via the `change-stream-namespaces` option
* New golang plugin functions `Process` and `Pipeline` added to the existing `Map` and `Filter` functions.  The `Process` function allows one to code complex processing after an event.  The `Process` function has access to the MongoDB session, the Elasticsearch client, the Elasticsearch bulk processor, and information about the change that occurred (insert, update, delete). The `Pipeline` function allows one to assign MongoDB pipeline stages to both direct reads and change streams. Since the pipeline stages may differ between direct reads and change streams the function is passed a boolean indicating the source of the data.  For example, a `$match` clause on the change stream may need to reference the `fullDocument` field since the root will be the change event. For direct reads the root will simply be the full document.
* New config option `pipeline` allows one to create aggregation pipelines in javascript for direct reads and change streams.  This can be used instead of the `Pipeline` function in a golang plugin.  The exported function in javascript takes a namespace and a boolean indicating whether or not the source was a change stream.  The function should return an array of pipeline stages to apply.
* New config option `pipe-allow-disk` which when enabled allows large pipelines to use the disk to save intermediate results.
* New global function available in javascript `script` functions named `pipe`.  The `pipe` function is simliar to existing `find` function but takes an array of aggregation pipeline stages as the first argument.

```
direct-read-namespaces = [test.test]
change-stream-namespaces = [test.test]
[[pipeline]]
script = """
module.exports = function(ns, changeStream) {
  if (changeStream) {
    return [
      { $match: {"fullDocument.foo": 1} }
    ];
  } else {
    return [
      { $match: {"foo": 1} }
    ];
  }
}
"""

  ]);
  return doc;

### [monstache v4.6.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.6.1)

* Performance and bug fixes in the gtm library 

### [monstache v3.13.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.13.1)

* Performance and bug fixes in the gtm library 

### [monstache v4.6.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.6.0)

* Performance improvements. Much of the performance gains come from an upgrade of the gtm library. This library now uses split vector failing back to a paginated range queries. Also, some buffering has been removed at the gtm level for certain operations.

### [monstache v3.13.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.13.0)

* Performance improvements. Much of the performance gains come from an upgrade of the gtm library. This library now uses split vector failing back to a paginated range queries. Also, some buffering has been removed at the gtm level for certain operations.

### [monstache v4.5.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.5.0)

* Adds an option `delete-index-pattern` to specify an Elasticsearch index pattern to scope stateless deletes.  Indexes outside of this
  pattern will not be considered when propogating deletes from MongoDB to Elasticsearch.  By default all Elasticsearch indexes are queried.
* Adds the ability to specify a global filter function in Javascript.  Previously, a filter function needed to be tied to a MongoDB namespace.
  Now you can leave off the namespace and the filter function will be applied to all namespaces.  The filter function will receive the document
  as the first argument and the MongoDB namespace as the second argument.
* Breaking change: `direct-read-cursors` and `direct-read-batch-size` have been removed as options.  The underlying gtm library of monstache has been
  upgraded and no longer supports parallelCollectionScan which is being removed in future versions of MongoDB.  Now gtm will use splitVector to divy
  up collections to read documents concurrently. Also, the batch size will be managed by MongoDB and not set explicitly.  See the gtm library docs for more information.
* Adds a boolean configuration option, `prune-invalid-json`, which defaults to false.  Set this to true if your MongoDB data has values such as +Inf,
  -Inf, or NaN which are not supported by the golang JSON parser and cause infinite error loops to occur.  With prune-invalid-json set to true Monstache
  will remove these values before indexing into Elasticsearch to avoid these errors.

### [monstache v3.12.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.12.0)

### [monstache v3.7.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.7.0)

* Fixed a bug where monstache would think direct reads were done when they had not even started
* Performance improvements for direct reads on large collections


### [monstache v4.0.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

* Monstache v4+ should be used for ES6+. There will still be bug fixes and maintenance done to the Monstache v3 releases to support ES2-5. You can still download v3.x releases from the downloads page or by directing go get to gopkg.in/rwynn/monstache.v3

* Fixes deprecation warnings during bulk indexing against ES6 because of renamed fields version and version_type

* Monstache will now default to using the ES type _doc (as opposed to the MongoDB collection name) when it detects ES 6.2+. This is the new recommended type name going forward. See issue #42.


### [monstache v3.6.5](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.5)

* Remove brittle normalization of index names, type names, and ids

* Start differentiating between releases supporting ES6+ and pre-ES6 by releasing from rel3 branch

* Soon a 4.0.0 release will be cut from master that will be ES6 forward. pre-ES6 will still be supported by downloading 3.x releases from the releases page or directing go get to gopkg.in/rwynn/monstache.v3

* Technically this release will still work with ES+ but that won't last forever. There are some deprecation warnings. In summary, if you need pre-ES6 use v3.x releases of monstache and v4.x releases of monstache for ES6+ going forward.


### [monstache v3.6.4](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.4)

* Trying to set the record for github releases in one night

* Fix a regression whereby monstache would exit after direct reads were complete when it should have kept tailing the oplog

### [monstache v3.6.3](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.3)

* Fix for a benign race condition in shutdown, introduced in 3.6.2, that caused a panic

### [monstache v3.6.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.2)

* Resume usage of upstream elastic client library now that fix for Elasticsearch going down has been merged
* When Elasticsearch goes down the elastic client will now put back pressure on Add and Flush calls. When Elasticsearch comes back up it will resume Adding and Flushing were it left off. Do to the blocking nature of Add and Flush the shutdown function of monstache has been refactored to take this into account. Shutdown will not hang if Elasticsearch is down. It will try to Flush pending documents but if this blocks due to a down server it will still exit after a 5 second deadline.

### [monstache v3.6.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.1)

* Added more detailed error logging. Each bulk request line that failed will be logged separately with details. This is much more lightweight than having to turn on verbose to get error details. Verbose is not a recommended setting for production.


### [monstache v3.6.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.6.0)

* This release focuses on improvements with regards to handling dropped connections to either Elasticsearch or MongoDB and resuming gracefully when they come back online


### [monstache v3.5.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.5.2)


* The previous release safeguards the integrity of inserts and updates with a version number, but neglected deletes.  This release adds versions to deletes such that an [insert, delete] sequence that gets sent to Elasticsearch in 2 different requests (due to `elasticsearch-max-conns` > 1) cannot actually perform a [delete, insert] instead.  In this case the insert would now carry a version number < the delete version number and be rejected.    

### [monstache v3.5.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.5.1)


* Fix for issue #37 - out of order indexing due to concurrent bulk indexing requests.  With `elasticsearch-max-conns` set to greater than 1 you may get out of order index requests; however after this fix **each document is versioned** such that Elasticsearch will not replace a newer version with an older one.  The version of the document is the timestamp from the MongoDB oplog of when the change (insert, update) occurred.  Out of order indexing typically happens when both an insert and an update are queued for a bulk request at around the same time.  In this case, do to the way the bulk processor multiplexes requests onto multiple connections, the document may be received out of order. 

### [monstache v3.5.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.5.0)


* Support for sharded MongoDB cluster.  See docs for details
* Performance optimizations
* Turn off bulk retries if configured to do so

### [monstache v3.4.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.4.2)

### [monstache v3.4.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.4.1)


* Fix for the javascript mapping functions.  An Otto Export does not appear to recurse into arrays.  Need to do a recursive Export for this scenario.  

### [monstache v3.4.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.4.0)


* Add ability to embed documents during the mapping phase.  Javascript plugins get 3 new global functions: findId, findOne, and find.  Golang plugins get access to the mgo.Session.  See the docs for details.  

### [monstache v3.3.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.3.1)


* Improve support for additional indexing metadata.
* Fix issue where indexing metadata was not honored

### [monstache v3.3.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

The server responds to the following endpoints (/started, /healthz, /config, and /stats).  The stats endpoint is only enabled if stats are enabled. The /started and /healthz endpoints can be used to check for liveness.  
* Upgraded the gtm library with performance improvements

### [monstache v3.2.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

### [monstache v2.2](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v2.2)

- Added configuration option for dropped databases and dropped collections.  See the README for more
  information.


### [monstache v2.1](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v2.1)

- Added support for dropped databases and collections. Now when you drop a database or collection from
  mongodb the corresponding indexes are deleted in elasticsearch.


### [monstache v2.0](https://github.com/rwynn/monstache/releases/tag/v2.0)

- Fixes an issue with the default mapping between mongodb and elasticsearch.  Previously, each database
  in mongodb was mapped to an index of the same name in elasticsearch.  This creates a problem because
  mongodb document ids are only guaranteed unique at the collection level.  If there are 2 or more documents
  in a mongodb database with the same id those documents were previously written to the same elasticsearch index.
  This fix changes the default mapping such that the entire mongodb document namespace (database + collection)
  is mapped to the destination index in elasticsearch.  This prevents the possibility of collisions within
  an index. Since this change requires reindexing of previously indexed data using monstache, the version 
  number of monstache was bumped to 2.  This change also means that by default you will have an index in
  elasticsearch for each mongodb collection instead of each mongod database.  So more indexes by default.
  You still have control to override the default mapping.  See the docs for how to explicitly control the index
  and type used for a particular mongodb namespace.
- Bumps the go version to 1.7.3
